<b> trekking and hiking </b>  my birthplace is Rome, but my home is Mazzin, in Val di Fassa,  where I learned that happiness is made of rocks, hiking boots and trees.  


<b> reading </b> back in 2009, a classmate said I was a naive reader, who preferred narrative over essays. Well, this still applies, luckily. 


<b> volleyball and really whatever sport </b>  Favourite time of the year?  Summer Olympic Games weeks. Too bad it only comes every four years (ok two, but even winter sports lovers will agree that  with the Winter Olympic Games all feels a bit different).
