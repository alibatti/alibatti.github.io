<b> trekking and hiking </b>  <br>
my birthplace is Rome, but my home is Mazzin, in Val di Fassa,  where I learned that happiness is made of rocks, hiking boots and trees.  
My trekking diary (in progress): <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1LPrLPw3xdlhifAfBI97iSLqygzLYiVH5&usp=sharing">here</a> 


<b> reading </b> <br>
back in 2009, a classmate said I was a naive reader, who preferred narrative over essays. Well, this still applies, luckily. 


<b> volleyball and really whatever sport </b> <br>
favourite time of the year?  Summer Olympic Games weeks. Too bad it only comes every four years.
